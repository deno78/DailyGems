### Build Failure Description
The build failed in the GitHub Actions job [#49314002607](https://github.com/deno78/DailyGems/actions/runs/17373323592/job/49314002607) due to a missing file:

- **File**: `android/app/google-services.json`

### Solution âœ…
~~Place your actual Firebase `google-services.json` in `android/app/` (see `google-services.json.example` for template).~~

**RESOLVED**: The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to automatically create `google-services.json` from the `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` repository secret if it exists. 

To enable Firebase features in CI/CD:
1. Go to Repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Add secret named `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` with your `google-services.json` file content
3. The build will automatically include Firebase features

See `docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md` for complete setup instructions including environment variable guidance.

## Steps to Resolve Gradle Build Failure in 'Build Android APK/AAB' Workflow

### 1. Update Workflow for Verbose Logging
Update the workflow YAML file to run Gradle with verbose logging by adding the following options:
```bash
--stacktrace --info
```
This will help in identifying the root cause of the build failure by providing detailed logs.

### 2. Verify Gradle and Java Versions
Ensure that the versions of Gradle and Java being used are compatible with the project. You can check the versions by running:
```bash
gradle -v
java -version
```
Make sure that they meet the project's requirements.

### 3. Ensure Required SDKs Are Installed
Verify that all the necessary SDKs are installed. You can do this by checking your local Android SDK installation or using the SDK Manager within Android Studio.

### 4. Check Compatibility of Plugins/Dependencies
Review the build.gradle file for any outdated or incompatible plugins and dependencies. Ensure that all plugins and libraries are compatible with the Gradle version being used.
